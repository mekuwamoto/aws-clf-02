# Advantages of cloud
## Trade capital expense for variable expense
You can **pay-on-demand**, meaning there is no upfront cost and pay for only what you consume or pay by hour, minutes or seconds, instead of paying for upfront costs of data centers and servers

## Benefits from massive economics of scale
You are **sharing the costs with other customers** to get unbeatable savings. Hundreds of thousands of customers utilizing a fraction of a server

## Stop guessing capacity
**Scale up or down** to meet the current need. Launch and destroy services whenever you need, instead of paying for idle or underutilized servers

## Increase speed and agility
**Launch resources within a few licks in minutes**, instead of waiting days or weeks of IT to implement the solution on-premises

## Stop spending money on running and maintaining data centers
**Focus on your own customers**, developing and configuring your applications, instead of operations such as racking, stacking and powering servers

## Go global in minutes
**Deploy your app in multiple regions around the world with a few clicks.** AWS provides lower latency and a better experience for your customers at minimal cost
