# Cloud Architecture Terminologies
Understanding cloud architecture requires familiarity with several key terms that describe how cloud systems are designed and managed. These terminologies form the foundation for building, maintaining, and scaling cloud-based solutions. Below are some of the most important concepts to know:

- Availability: Ensure a service remains available
- Scalability: Grow rapidly or unimpeded
- Elasticity: Ability to shrink or grow to meet the demand
- Fault Tolerance: Ability to prevent failure
- Disaster Recovery: Ability to recover from failure
